### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly mixed week with improvements and regressions mostly balancing themselves out. The highlight of this week is we have now started to adopt a new performance triage process which will label PRs that introduce performance regressions with the `perf-regression` label. Authors and/or reviewers are expected to justify their performance regression either by a short summary of why the change is worth it despite the regression or by creating an issue to follow-up on the regression.

We hope this process will lead to better compiler performance in the long term.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [5a78340..9a27044](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=5a7834050f3a0ebcd117b4ddf0bc1e8459594309&end=9a27044f42ace9eb652781b53f598e25d4e7e918&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 3 Improvements, 2 Mixed
1 of them in rollups

# Quote of the Week

> One thing I like about Rust is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another Rust programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.
